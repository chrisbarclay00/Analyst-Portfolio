# Introduction
-   5G technology expansion and undersea cable network growth drive the 21st-century telecom industry.
-   Unequal gaps in global connectivity and investment persist in telecom advancement and development.
-   Using data from the ITU and World Bank, I assess correlations between annual investment in telecommunications, total gdp and gdp-per-capita, industry competition, and ease-of-business. Specifically, I assess:

      1.   Global variance in domestic and foreign annual telecommunications investment.

      2.   Correlation between domestic and foreign annual investment and factors like economic strength, level of competition, and ease of business.

# Data and Methodology

-   I compiled two datasets (‘telecom.csv’ and ‘fdi_telecom.csv’) with data from [the International Telecommunication Union](https://datahub.itu.int/%22), [the International Monetary Fund](https://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/NGDPD@WEO/OEMDC/ADVEC/WEOWORLD%5D), and [the World Bank](https://archive.doingbusiness.org/en/data).
-   Most (~75-80%) data fell between 2000-2021.
-   To visualize variance in domestic and foreign telecommunications investment, I created two graphs (global maps) just with the ITU's data.
-   To assess correlation between annual investment and my factor variables, I used multivariate regression analysis.
-   I used fixed country effects to account for systematic differences among countries.

# Findings
+   There are stark gaps in time-series ITU data on domestic and foreign investment.
+   Foreign annual investment data too limited and spurious to draw insights.
+   United States and China had considerable domestic annual telecommunications investment.
+   Total GDP and GDP-per-capita strongly correlated with domestic annual telecommunications investment.
+   No significant correlation between annual investment and level of industry competition.
+   No significant correlation between annual investment and ease of business indicators.
+   Noticeable surge in annual telecommunications investment post-AT&T breakup; significance difficult to gauge due to ITU data limitations (2000-2022).
+   Further research needed to evaluate the impact of industry competition on annual telecommunications investment.
