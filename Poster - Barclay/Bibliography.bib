	abstract = {This study provides a retrospective analysis exploring competition in the US telecommunication industry, a decade after passage of the highly deregulatory Telecommunications Act of 1996. Using history as a guide, it reviews recent merger activity facilitated by the Act, profiles the present state of concentration in cable and telephony and explores prospects for cross-media competition permitted by the Act.
Study results suggest that industry concentration in these telecommunication industries has increased dramatically since the mid-1990s, with the top four firms controlling over 60\% of the market in each industry. The stand-alone long distance industry has been virtually eliminated by the acquisitions of AT\&T and MCI by Regional Bell Operating companies, whose extensive lobbying efforts and lawsuits, challenging service restrictions under the Act and their enforcement, play to RBOC advantages in scale and local loop control. Despite prospects for competition stemming from Internet and wireless alternatives, recent consolidation has been accompanied by hyper-inflationary rate increases in both industries. Recent developments, including AT\&T's acquisition by former Baby Bell progeny SBC and its earlier sale of AT\&T cable assets to Comcast, may thus signal a new era of competitive “detente” among telecommunication providers. Implications for cross-industry competition between cable and telephone industries for broadband, cable and voice services are explored.},

	abstract = {American society today is shaped not nearly as much by vast open spaces as it is by vast, bureaucratic organizations. Over half the working population toils away at enterprises with 500 or more employees--up from zero percent in 1800. Is this institutional immensity the logical outcome of technological forces in an all-efficient market, as some have argued? In this book, the first organizational history of nineteenth-century America, Yale sociologist Charles Perrow says no. He shows that there was nothing inevitable about the surge in corporate size and power by century's end. Critics railed against the nationalizing of the economy, against corporations' monopoly powers, political subversion, environmental destruction, and "wage slavery." How did a nation committed to individual freedom, family firms, public goods, and decentralized power become transformed in one century? Bountiful resources, a mass market, and the industrial revolution gave entrepreneurs broad scope. In Europe, the state and the church kept private organizations small and required consideration of the public good. In America, the courts and business-steeped legislators removed regulatory constraints over the century, centralizing industry and privatizing the railroads. Despite resistance, the corporate form became the model for the next century. Bureaucratic structure spread to government and the nonprofits. Writing in the tradition of Max Weber, Perrow concludes that the driving force of our history is not technology, politics, or culture, but large, bureaucratic organizations. Perrow, the author of award-winning books on organizations, employs his witty, trenchant, and graceful style here to maximum effect. Colorful vignettes abound: today's headlines echo past battles for unchecked organizational freedom; socially responsible alternatives that were tried are explored along with the historical contingencies that sent us down one road rather than another. No other book takes the role of organizations in America's development as seriously. The resultant insights presage a new historical genre.},

	volume = {50},
	issn = {0003-603X},
	abstract = {This article reviews the economic support for William Baxter's view that antitrust is more, not less, necessary to prevent monopolization in regulated sectors than in the economy as a whole. It then reviews the Supreme Court's rationale for taking the reverse position in Verizon v. Trinko. In doing so, it assesses not only the Court's reversal of the Baxter doctrine, but also its other rationales for finding not just that regulation limited Verizon's antitrust liability, but that its conduct generically is not an antitrust violation. As both the antitrust laws and the Telecommunications Act of 1996 that instituted the regulatory framework for Verizon's interconnection obligations are creatures of Congress, the paper briefly discusses the role economic policy arguments should play in Supreme Court deliberations. It concludes with a summary of the implications of "Trinko v. Baxter" for the promotion of competition in regulated sectors.},
